# react-counter

Basic counter that manipulates the state by using React Hooks (specifically useState hook).

Â¿Why should I learn how to use hooks?

- They let us work with functional components and still get access to the state and the component's lifecycle.
- It's easier to re-use functions when they are inside a functional components. No need to bind "this" to our methods.
- It just looks cleaner.
